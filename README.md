## Introduction

This scalable solution provides a customized Amazon Q Business web application designed to help public sector agencies securely accelerate their adoption of Generative AI. Built with AWS Amplify Compute, it enables server-side rendering for dynamic anonymous session generation while providing zero-infrastructure management and automatic CI/CD deployment from GitHub.

The application features **[custom theming](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md)** for organizational branding and **automatic session management** that creates new **[anonymous chat sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/using-web-experience.html#web-experience-anonymous)** for each user visit.

By leveraging Amazon Q Business's [anonymous web experience URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_CreateAnonymousWebExperienceUrl.html), the solution provides secure, temporary access without requiring user authentication.

## Getting Started

#### Prerequisites:
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Node.js 22+ installed locally
- AWS CLI configured
- Git repository

## Important: AWS WAF Regional Requirements

**For AWS WAF integration with Amplify applications:**

> "Notice that the AWS WAF stack must be deployed to the US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1) Region. The Amplify application stack can be deployed to a different Region. You must create the web ACL that you want to associate with the Amplify app in the Global (CloudFront) Region. Regional web ACLs might already exist in your AWS account, but they are not compatible with Amplify."

Source: [AWS Documentation - Enabling AWS WAF for an Amplify application using the AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/amplify-waf-CDK.html)

**Options:**
- Deploy to `us-east-1` region (recommended for simplicity)
- Deploy without WAF using `--disable-waf` parameter (see deployment options below)

## Setup

**Step 1: Clone and push to your repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-secure-web-experiences-for-amazon-q-business.git
cd sample-secure-web-experiences-for-amazon-q-business
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_NEW_REPO.git
git push -u origin main
npm install
```

**Step 2: Deploy the infrastructure.**

Deployment takes approximately 5-10 minutes.

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh [stack-name] [branch] [github-repo] [github-token] [theme-dir] [--disable-waf]
```

**Parameters:**
- `stack-name` (optional): CloudFormation stack name (default: "qbusiness-public-sector")
- `branch` (optional): Git branch name (default: "main") 
- `github-repo` (optional): Your GitHub repository URL (e.g., "https://github.com/username/repo")
- `github-token` (optional): GitHub personal access token with **admin:repo_hook** scope ([create one here](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens)) for automatic deployment (or see [GitHub App setup with CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/setting-up-GitHub-access.html#setting-up-github-app-cloudformation))
- `theme-dir` (optional): Theme directory name from `assets/themes/` (default: "public-sector")
- `--disable-waf` (optional): Deploy without AWS WAF protection

**Example with WAF disabled (any region):**
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh qbusiness-public-sector main "https://github.com/myusername/my-repo" "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx" "public-sector" --disable-waf
```

**Example with WAF enabled (requires us-east-1):**
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh qbusiness-public-sector main "https://github.com/myusername/my-repo" "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```
*Note: Without GitHub integration, this creates Q Business infrastructure and local .env file for development, but no Amplify deployment.*

+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

🎉 DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE!

NEXT STEPS:
   1. Visit your AmplifyDefaultDomain to verify deployment
   2. Test locally: npm install && npm start

✨ Thank you for using Amazon Q Business!
```

**Step 3: Test locally (optional).**

```bash
npm install && npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to test locally.

**Note**: Your Amplify app will auto-deploy when changes are committed to the main branch.

**Production Security**: For production deployments, remove `http://localhost:3000` from the `DeveloperOrigins` parameter in your CloudFormation stack to prevent local development access.

## Reference Architecture

![Q Business with AWS Amplify Architecture](docs/images/q-business-with-aws-amplify-architecture-diagram.png)

Built with Express.js and deployed on AWS Amplify using CloudFormation for infrastructure management, this demo solution creates a secure, themed Q Business deployment with the following components:

- **Q Business Application**: Anonymous access with custom theming
- **Web Experience**: Customized branding and styling
- **Amplify Hosting**: Server-side rendering with Express.js
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: Security protection for the web application
- **Secrets Manager**: Secure storage of Q Business configuration
- **S3 Bucket**: Theme assets (CSS, fonts, logos)
- **IAM Roles**: Least-privilege permissions for Amplify compute

## Project Structure

## Amplify GitHub App Migration

After deployment, you may see this message in the AWS Amplify console:

![Amplify GitHub App Migration](docs/images/amplify-Migrate-to-our-GitHub-app-message.png)

**Recommendation**: Click the "Start migration" button to migrate to the new GitHub App integration. Use a GitHub app instead of OAuth to access your code repository to trigger builds. GitHub apps offer the same experience but with fewer required permissions.

## Cleanup

To remove all AWS resources created by this solution:

```bash
./scripts/cleanup.sh [stack-name]
```

**Parameters:**
- `stack-name` (optional): CloudFormation stack name to delete (default: "qbusiness-public-sector")

**Example:**
```bash
./scripts/cleanup.sh
```

The script will:
1. Empty the S3 theme assets bucket (all versions)
2. Delete the Secrets Manager secret
3. Delete the CloudFormation stack and all associated resources
